## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

This challenge was a good way for me to review my learning as well as to implement some of the "industry standard" code used. One such example of this was the following code added below to center my content both horizontally and vertically for all screen sizes, which was handy. 

```css
body {
  display: flex;
  min-height: 80vh;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  font-size: 15px;
}
```
